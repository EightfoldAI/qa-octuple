## About

This set of Prototypes demonstrate upstream usage of Octuple implementations.
Octuple creates a shared language and visual consistency across different pages and channels.
It represents a collection of assets, utilities, and React components for building web applications.

- Design and development work may be created and replicated quickly at scale.
- Alleviates strain on design resources to focus on larger, more complex problems.
- Creates a unified language within and between cross-functional teams.
- Creates visual consistency across products, channels, and potentially siloed departments.
- Serves as an educational tool and reference for designers and content contributors.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing pages by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

`API routes` with [Route handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/mockdata](http://localhost:3000/api/mockdata). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/mockdata/route.ts`.

## Recomendation for better development
